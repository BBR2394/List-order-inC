# Lits Order Program

# the goal
it is just to code ^^ i used to code in C in my school, but now i have almost finished it (in reality it is even more complicated) and i just want to code in a language and in a way i know perfeclty.

~~Now i have a job (i have an internship) and i am working in vue js, so web front end programming, but i need to program in a more "normal" language (so not a web language ^^)~~

Now i am looking for a part time job to do my Master in IT technologies
